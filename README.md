# MEC Developer Profiles
###### Developers of Model Engineering College, assemble!

So, we decided to have profiles for every developer at MEC, do you have something to publish for your own profile with our platform?

## How to add yourself?

All we need is the link to your website! This could be your github pages portfolio or a website that you setup with any other service, containing your details and the content you create. We also accept blogs that have technical content on them. This is afterall, a developer community and we only accept work that has atleast one article/project on technical work, including final year projects or side projects. Please look inside `~sample/index.html` for a template to work with.

We prefer your own webiste, even if it is based off of a template.
